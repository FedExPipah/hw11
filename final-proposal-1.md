# Your Project Title Here
1. Moving creatures  

One-sentence summary of your project goes here; then fill out each of the following sections.
Moving creatures is a project that will interact with children at random public spaces.

## Summary
A paragraph or two describing what you are building for your final project.
Include a discussion of how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

I want to focus on interaction with little kids, 
and make a cute, car-like robot that can bring them happiness and also communicate with them. 
There will be many moving creatures surrounded by children, 
when they touch them, the creature will say different words such as “Hello” and “How are you” 
that expect children to answer and have some interaction. 

## Component Parts
Describe the components, or pieces, that make up your project.
Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. 
You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

I will use 4 DC motors / creatures in a total of 5. 
They will have distance sensors on them so they can move around by themselves, 
they will also have the light sensor on their head because when people touch them they have to talk. 
On the creature’s upper body will have some shining LEDs to catch children's eyes and make them feel interested.
