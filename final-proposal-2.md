2. Singing annoying alarm bot 

One-sentence summary
2. Singing annoying alarm bot is an annoying alarm that will make noise on the time that people set up.  


## Summary
2. It is always hard to get up in the morning especially wintertime, 
so I want to make a super loud and annoying robot that 
can make sure it can wake people up in the cold winter :) 

## Component Parts
2. The alarm will have a distance sensor and a light sensor 
because it can move around and when it’s near you it will “SING” 
until you pressed the button on its head.
